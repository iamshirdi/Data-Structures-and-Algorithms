# Sort Algorithm Comparisons (Bubble,Merge,Selection) 
- Which sorting algorithm is best based on time and space complexity measured

- Three already-compiled C programs, sort1, sort2, and sort3. Each of these programs implements a different sorting algorithm: selection sort, bubble sort, or merge sort (though not necessarily in that order!).

- sort1 uses: Bubble  

How do you know?: It takes more time/ less as data increases but not constant like selection which is same for random,sorted the time

- sort2 uses: Merge 

How do you know?: IT takes less around 8 seconds same as sorted data when compared to others on random50000 large data while selection performs same

- sort3 uses: Selection 

How do you know?: It takes longest on already sorted text file 500000 compared to others and around same on random too . constant
